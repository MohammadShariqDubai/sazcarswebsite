In order to reactivate your privilege to use the features of SAZ CARS’s Website or Mobile application, you would need to pay a deposit again.
    SAZ CARS gives the Buyer the opportunity to set a delivery date for the Acquired Vehicle. As long as the vehicle is stored with SAZ CARS (starting from the due date of the vehicle invoice), the Buyer will be charged a storage fee per day.</p>
    <p>The vehicle might remain stored with SAZ CARS, as long as the vehicle invoice has not been settled. Hence, the storage fees can accumulate higher amounts than the storage fees assumed for the scheduled delivery date set by the Buyer. lf the Buyer would not like to use the storage service, the Buyer needs to settle the vehicle invoices by their respective due dates.</p>   
    <p>SAZ CARS, in its sole discretion, might offer payment terms, which allow the Buyer to postpone the payment due, date in exchange for a fee. The Buyer agrees to adhere to the terms and conditions of this delayed payment due date process. The Buyer, in exchange for a delayed payment due date, has to:</p>  
    <ul>
        <li>Secure the full Vehicle Purchase Price with a security cheque.</li>
        <li>Hold SAZ CARS harmless against any liability arising from the Buyer possessing the Acquired Vehicle prior to title transfer.</li>
        <li>Immediately return the Acquired Vehicle to SAZ CARS if the Buyer defaults on full payment on Payment Due Date</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SAZ CARS reserves the right to charge the Buyer any loss incurred due to default in full payment of the Acquired Vehicle.</p>
    <p>SAZ CARS, in its sole discretion, might offer a vehicle passing (vehicle roadworthiness certificate acquired by authorized testing stations), insurance brokerage, title transfer, delivery, storage, plate number, administration and other added services, which will be imposed upon bidding on the desired vehicle. It is the Buyer's responsibility to maintain and procure to SAZ CARS all documentation required to fulfill these services. If documentation is invalid or missing or if Buyer does not qualify for such services for any reason out of SAZ CARS's control, SAZ CARS reserves the right to keep the fees charged for such services.</p>
    <p>Effective from January 01, 2018, Value Added Tax (VAT) at the legally valid rate will be included on all the goods and services provided by SAZ CARS in compliance with the UAE VAT legislation or any applicable jurisdiction. SAZ CARS, during the purchase and/or sales process might display a payable VAT amount, based on historical values, whereby the actual payable amount might differ in the final invoice. For the avoidance of doubt, the final payable amount might also be higher than initially displayed during the purchase and/or sales process.</p>
    <p>SAZ CARS does also sell internationally, whereby customs, any border-related, any shipping-related, and any handling-related and/or any tax and duty charges might apply.</p>
    <p>The Buyer accepts paying the full amount occurred, which might exceed the amount displayed during purchase.</p>
    <h2>--BUYING POLICIES--</h2>
    <p>SAZ CARS is conducting auctions with registered members. If a member bids on a vehicle, that member is obligated to complete the transaction, if the seller agrees to the offer. Once a price bid has been submitted, it cannot be retracted, deleted, or cancelled.</p>
    <p>SAZ CARS is in no way responsible if a member’s registration information, including ID and password is lost, misplaced or stolen. SAZ CARS is not responsible for any cancelled bids. SAZ CARS still reserves the right to reject or void bids for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion. Should a dispute arise regarding a bid, SAZ CARS is the exclusive deciding authority with sole and absolute discretion in resolving disputes.</p>
    <p>Dealers agree to indemnify, defend, and hold SAZ CARS harmless from any and all liability arising out of decisions made in resolving disputes. SAZ CARS may, in its sole and absolute discretion and with or without notice, postpone or cancel a sale or withdraw a vehicle from sale. SAZ CARS will neither have liability nor obligation to members as a result of any vehicle withdrawal, or sale cancellation or postponement.</p>
    <p>If a member's bid has been accepted, the member is obligated to purchase the vehicle, and will be notified as such by SAZ CARS. Any bid or purchase transaction is valid for 21 days and needs to be fulfilled by the Buyer. Following notification, the member will have the standard number of days allowed to pick up or accept delivery of the vehicle before late-payment and storage fees apply. SAZ CARS shall not be responsible for damage that is brought to the attention of SAZ CARS management after the vehicle is retrieved (picked up or delivered). Buyer will have been deemed to accept delivery of the vehicle in its present condition once the online purchase transaction is completed and the vehicle is ready for delivery or available to be picked up by the Buyer.</p>
    <h2>--SALES CONTRACT--</h2>  
    <p>Your price bid and our confirmation of the vehicle purchase transaction constitutes a legally binding sales contract.</p>
    <p>This sales contract will be subject to these TAC. We will expect you as the registered and activated member (the “Buyer”) to pay the full amount on or before the invoice due date. In some cases, the original owner of the vehicle still has an outstanding loan amount with a financial institution, which might delay the deregistration process and hence the Delivery of the Acquired Vehicle for several months. The latter is subject to the respective bank release processes and out of SAZ CARS’s control. It is the Buyer’s duty, either in person or through a third party to honor the price bid and vehicle purchase transaction, even if there is significant delay in the Delivery of the Acquired Vehicle. The Buyer indemnifies the Seller for possible delays in the Delivery of the Acquired Vehicle.</p>
    <p>The Buyer and the respective seller (hereinafter known as "Seller", which could be SAZ CARS or any other seller using SAZ CARS’s platform, depending on the individual type of transaction chosen from time to time) shall collectively be known herein as the “Sales Parties”, WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell the vehicle as described on SAZ CARS’s Website or Mobile application, known herein as the "Acquired Vehicle", under the terms and conditions set forth in this TAC document; WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase the Acquired Vehicle offered for sale by Seller under the terms and conditions set forth in this TAC document; and, therefore, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises and other valuable consideration exchanged by the Sales Parties as set forth herein, the Sales Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree to the Total Purchase Price displayed and confirmed on SAZ CARS’s Website or Mobile application. The actual amount payable displayed in the final invoice might differ from the amount initially displayed during the purchase and/or sales process on SAZ CARS’s Website or Mobile applications and/or apps. The Total Purchase Price payment can be made by the Buyer to SAZ CARS by bank transfer. SAZ CARS will settle the outstanding payment with the seller on behalf of the Buyer, in case the seller is not SAZ CARS.</p>
    <p>The bank transfer details will be displayed on SAZ CARS’s Website or Mobile application and confirmed via  </p>
    <p>Email to the Buyer’s registered email address.</p> 
    <h2>Delivery of Acquired Vehicle and Conveyance of Title</h2>
    <p>Delivery of Acquired Vehicle: Once Buyer’s payment has been received on SAZ CARS’s bank account (or SAZ CARS has cleared Acquired Vehicle for delivery, in case of approved postponed payment due dates falling after desired delivery dates), SAZ CARS shall deliver the Acquired Vehicle, and Buyer shall take possession of same, at SAZ CARS's premises or at Buyer’s chosen premises during confirmation of delivery services (which might be enforced by SAZ CARS at its own discretion).</p>

It is the Buyer’s duty to appear at the agreed upon delivery location on the Delivery Date.</p>
    <p>SAZ CARS might send a pick-up code to the Buyer, which the Buyer, or anyone the Buyer has given the pick-up code to, can use to pick-up the Purchased Vehicle from the SAZ CARS or from the agreed upon delivery location. As the Buyer is the only recipient of the pick-up code, it will authorize release of the Purchased Vehicle to anyone presenting this code to SAZ CARS. SAZ CARS will consider anyone with the pick-up code as being authorized by the Buyer to pick up the Purchased Vehicle. The Buyer indemnifies the SAZ CARS for any potential loss or damage incurred by this described vehicle pick-up code process. If Buyer, or anyone the Buyer has authorized, fails to appear at the agreed upon delivery location on the Delivery Date to accept possession of the Acquired Vehicle, then risk of loss passes to the Buyer on the Delivery Date and additional fees, such as storage or late payment fees, will apply according to our Terms & Conditions.</p>
    <p>Conveyance of Title: Seller shall convey title to Buyer upon delivery of the Acquired Vehicle to Buyer. Seller agrees and covenants to execute all documents presented by Buyer, which are necessary to finalize transfer of title and registration upon the Acquired Vehicle to Buyer.</p>
    <p>As a registered and activated member, the Buyer hereby acknowledges, agrees, and warrants, upon signing this Membership Agreement, that Buyer hereby grants full and unconditional authority to SAZ CARS or to any SAZ CARS affiliated third party showrooms or representatives, to conduct the inspection and necessary title transfer of the vehicle. The signing of the Membership Agreement negates the need for the Seller and the Buyer to be present in the showroom for the sale and/or purchase of the vehicle. The Buyer grants full authority to SAZ CARS and the Seller, each individually, without any limitation to transfer the vehicle to the Buyer.</p>
    <h2>Representations, Warranties and Disclosures</h2>

    <h2>--GENERAL INFORMATION--</h2>
    <p>The TAC constitutes the entire agreement between you and SAZ CARS and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and SAZ CARS. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. You and SAZ CARS expressly exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Sale of Goods Act (Ontario), as amended, replaced or re-enacted from time to time.

You and SAZ CARS agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the United Arab Emirates. The failure of SAZ CARS to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TAC shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TAC is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TAC shall remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use shall be resolved by binding arbitration held in the United Arab Emirates and before a single arbitrator, who is independent of the parties, legally trained and experienced in the field of information technology. The United Arab Emirates is our country of domicile.</p>
